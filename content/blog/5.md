# Simplifying Model 720: My Experience Investing Abroad

Over the past few years, I’ve started investing in stocks through a foreign platform called **DeGiro**. However, since it’s not a Spanish platform, it doesn’t automatically report **Model 720**, a mandatory form in Spain for declaring foreign assets. This form is divided into three main categories:

1. **Cash in foreign bank accounts**
2. **Real estate assets**
3. **Stocks and similar assets**

In my case, I’ve been investing abroad for a while, so I decided to make the process of generating Model 720 easier. Not only to avoid potential fines but also to help others who are likely in the same situation as me. To achieve this, I created a website called **[720 DeGiro](https://www.720degiro.com)**.

## What Does 720 DeGiro Offer?

On this website, in less than **five minutes**, you can generate Model 720 if it’s your first time submitting it to the Tax Agency. The process is simple and done through a short form. Additionally, the help page explains all the steps required to obtain the file, which can be exported directly from the DeGiro platform.

### How Does It Work?

1. **Fill out the form**: Enter the necessary data to generate Model 720.
2. **Export the file**: Download the generated file in a format compatible with the Tax Agency.
3. **Submit the file**: Upload the file to the Tax Agency’s website and complete the submission.

The process is designed to be as intuitive as possible, and the help page details how to submit the file correctly.

### Pricing and Future of the Project

The service costs **5 euros**, although it’s initially **free** while in the testing phase. This allows us to gauge whether there’s a market of people willing to pay to save time with this system. In the future, we plan to include other brokers and the possibility of managing second and subsequent submissions to the Tax Agency.

## Technology Behind 720 DeGiro

This project was developed using **Vue 3** with **Nuxt 3** and **Nuxt UI 3 Alpha**, and it’s deployed on **Vercel**. For error tracking, we use **Sentry**, and we connect to a database through **Supabase**, using the **Frontend for Backend** pattern to ensure data security. Additionally, we use **Resend** for email delivery and **Stripe** as the payment gateway, integrated with **webhooks** that connect to Vercel functions.

The project was developed in one month, during **January 2025**, with the goal of analyzing the viability of a product useful for the market while also improving my technical skills.

## Want to Try It?

I’ve included an explanatory video of the process and a link for you to check it out. Any constructive feedback or criticism is welcome through comments or email. Thank you very much!
