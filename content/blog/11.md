Recently, I encountered an issue when using Nuxt Disqus and the Disqus iframe in a project that utilizes TailwindCSS v4. This issue arises because Tailwind v4 uses colors in the `oklch` format, which breaks JavaScript style analysis and causes exceptions.

## The Problem

Disqus uses `getComputedStyle` to determine whether to render the light or dark version of the iframe. However, with Tailwind v4, colors in the `oklch` format are not compatible with JavaScript style analysis, leading to errors.

## The Solution

Thanks to JavaScript's flexibility, we can override the `getComputedStyle` method to handle `oklch` values and prevent exceptions. Here is the code I used to solve the issue:

```javascript
// Save the original getComputedStyle function
const originalGetComputedStyle = window.getComputedStyle;

// Override getComputedStyle
window.getComputedStyle = function (element, pseudoElt) {
  const styles = originalGetComputedStyle(element, pseudoElt);

  // Return a proxy to intercept calls to getPropertyValue
  return new Proxy(styles, {
    get(target, prop) {
      if (prop === 'getPropertyValue') {
        return (property) => {
          const value = target.getPropertyValue(property);
          // Replace "oklch" values or handle them as needed
          if (value.includes('oklch')) {
            if (document.documentElement.classList.contains("dark")) {
              return 'black';
            }
            return 'white';
          }
          return value;
        };
      }
      return target[prop];
    },
  });
};
```

## Alternatives

There are other solutions to this problem, such as manually changing the background colors in the Disqus iframe. You can find more information in these links:

- [Issue reported in Disqus React](https://github.com/disqus/disqus-react/issues/153)

## Conclusion

This solution allowed me to maintain compatibility with Tailwind v4 without needing to directly modify the background colors. I hope this alternative is helpful for other developers facing the same issue.
